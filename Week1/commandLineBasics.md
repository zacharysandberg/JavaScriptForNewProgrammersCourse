#DOS vs. BASH (Bourne Again Shell)
--In windows the default command line is DOS
--Dos is limited compared to the BASH
--In Windows to overcome the limitations of BASH you have two options
  You can use the GitBash... could pose a challenge finding your directory. 
--In Mac the default command prompt (aka the Terminal) is a utility found in the Finder->Applicatins->Utilities
###Here is a list of the most common BASH commands for this class

- cd ..  #move up one directory
- cd     #move to your home directory
- cd SUBFOLDER #move to a child directory
- cd /PATH/FROM/ROOT 

where the PATH FROM and ROOT are actual folders 
along the path starting from the root
pwd    #print the full path of your current directory

- ls

list all files and directories under the current directory

- ls -al 

list a detailed list of files and directories in your current directory
rm FILENAME #be very careful with this command once the file is gone it's gone forever
