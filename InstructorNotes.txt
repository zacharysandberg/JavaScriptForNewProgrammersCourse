//so.. what about these things vs. these things
var vs. (let + const)
function vs. arrow functions
destructuring
string interpolation

//What about jquery?

//What about prototype chains

//what about enumeral properies, own properties,

//what about destructuring
let student = {firstName: "Bart", lastName: "simpson"}
let { firstName } = student;
let students = ["lisa", "bart", "baby"]
let family = [...students, "marge", "homer"]
let studentAlso = {...student, age: 20 }

//what about making readonly

//what about extending prototypes

//In javascript properties can access two ways
person.firstName = "Bart"
person["firstName"] = "Lisa"

//works
person["First Name"] = "Marge"
//does not works becuase typed props cannot have spaces
person.First Name = "Marge" 

//what about for of and for each

//what is the deal with classes

//what about NaN?

//What about infinity

//what about handling money

//what about handling fractionals
